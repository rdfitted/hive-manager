Key pattern: PersistedAgentInfo stores role as String (e.g., 'Queen', 'Worker(1)') requiring string parsing to reconstruct AgentRole enum.","files_touched":["src-tauri/src/commands/session_commands.rs","src-tauri/src/session/controller.rs","src-tauri/src/lib.rs","src/lib/stores/sessions.ts","src/lib/components/SessionSidebar.svelte"]}
